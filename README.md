##What's Countly?
Countly is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. It collects data from mobile phones, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and mobile SDK that sends this data (for iOS & Android).

Below you can find Countly SDK repositories;

- [Countly API Server (Countly-API)](https://github.com/gabrielrinaldi/Countly-API-Heroku)
- [Countly Android SDK (countly-sdk-android)](https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-android)
- [Countly iOS SDK (countly-sdk-ios)](https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-ios)

##How do I install Countly Frontend Server on Heroku?

1. Configure the [Countly API Server](https://github.com/gabrielrinaldi/Countly-API-Heroku) first
2. Create a Heroku server (Cedar)
3. Add [SendGrid add-on](https://addons.heroku.com/sendgrid) by running `heroku addons:add sendgrid:starter`
4. Run `heroku config:add SENDGRID_SENDER=example@example.com`
5. Configure this repository to push to Heroku
6. Run `heroku config:add COUNTLYDB=Your COUNTLYDB from the API server`
7. Change server on countly.common.js (`countlyCommon.READ_API_URL = "http://your_api_server/o"`)
8. Push to Heroku and you are done

I am using S3 now for handling app icons. You have to setup your keys for it to work:

1. Run `heroku config:add S3_ACCESS_KEY=key S3_ACCESS_SECRET=secret S3_BUCKET=bucket`
2. Update the path with your url in the files (Search for `appimage`)
3. Make sure the file is 25x25 (had to remove imagemagick)

##Frontend
